            Step-by-Step: How to Edit an Image with Nano Banana AI
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-5">
            <strong>Upload Your Image</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="mb-5">
            Start by selecting the photo you want to work on. Nano Banana
            supports common formats, so you don’t need to worry about
            compatibility.

            <strong>Choose Your Edit Goal</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="mb-5">
            Do you want to enhance lighting? Remove an object? Replace the

            Once edits are in place, preview the result. If it looks great,

            happy.

            Tips for Better Edits When You Edit an Image with Nano Banana AI
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-5">
            Start with the best original photo you can. The cleaner the input,
            the better the output.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-5">
            Make subtle adjustments. Fading in a little brightness often looks
            better than a big jump.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-5">
            Use the preview feature to compare before/after carefully.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-5">
            When removing objects, go slowly—do small areas at a time for more
            control.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-5">
            Save your progress so you can return to earlier versions if needed.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p class="mb-5">
            Photos are more than just memories—they’re your voice. They shape
            first impressions, tell stories, and connect people. When you edit
            an image with Nano Banana AI, you take that power into your hands.
            You don’t have to struggle with steep learning curves or complex
            software. You can simply make your images shine.
